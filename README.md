# Expenses Project

This project was created while while I was taking "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" course (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux).

The software controls a list of expenses and shows a chart by year. The user can input more expenses and see chart changes.

I developed the project after taking the classes, to test if I had actually learnd the content. The styles were made by the teacher, I just wrote react code.

The project was deployed to vercel, available at: https://exepenses.vercel.app/

## Study objectives

While developing this project, I practiced basic react concepts. Managing states, working with events, rendering lists and content conditionally. Then, I styled the components using CSS Modules. At last, I wrote unit test to the components.

## Running the project

After cloning the repository, open the terminal and go to the project's folder.

Run the command:
```
npm install
```
Wait until the installation process end.

Then run the command:
```
npm start
```
It should open your browser on http://localhost:3000. If not, open the browser manually and enter the previous url.
